# Privacy Policy for Transaction Search Extension
_Last updated: 24 April 2025_

The **Transaction Search** extension is a lightweight Chrome extension developed to support **Arrayan**, a blockchain-based food supply chain solution built on **ResilientDB**. The extension allows users to quickly search for transactions and supply chain data hosted on the ResilientDB cloud instance.

## 1. Information We Collect

This extension does **not collect, store, or transmit** any personal information, browsing history, or user data.

The extension performs a simple search operation by interacting with **https://cloud.resilientdb.com/**. It does **not persist or log any information**, nor does it access user credentials, cookies, or private browsing data.

## 2. Permissions Used

The extension requests the following permissions:

- `activeTab` â€“ Allows the extension to read the URL of the currently active tab in Chrome. This is used solely to allow interaction with the Arrayan application, when the user is actively using the platform.
- `host_permissions` â€“ Grants access to:
  - `https://cloud.resilientdb.com/*` â€“ This is the official hosted instance of ResilientDB and is used to query blockchain transaction data relevant to the Arrayan project.

**No other sites are accessed or modified**, and no data is transmitted to third-party services.

## 3. How We Use Data

The extension only facilitates blockchain queries to the official ResilientDB endpoint. These queries are based on user-provided product or transaction inputs. **All interactions are temporary and exist only in the current browser session**.

We do **not**:
- Track user interactions
- Store search history
- Collect personal or identifiable information
- Use analytics or third-party cookies

## 4. Security

The extension does not require login or authentication. All data is securely handled within the browser and transmitted directly to the ResilientDB endpoint over HTTPS.

## 5. Third-Party Services

No third-party services are integrated. The extension strictly communicates with:
- `https://cloud.resilientdb.com` â€“ The official cloud instance for querying blockchain data.

## 6. Updates

This policy may be updated as the extension evolves. Any changes will be posted in future versions of this policy and/or communicated through the project repository.

## 7. Contact
